The is an instruction for how to use my program. to play Tricksy Battle, a card game played between two players using a modified deck. The deck excludes kings and so it is a 48 card deck.

How to Play:

-Leading player is chosen randomly
-Players take turns typing the name of the card they want to play

-After every round a card in the deck is removed and shown to both players
